25.0.0 (July 22, 2025)
======================
A new major release introducing critical fixes and important new functionality.
Most notably, it includes a hotfix for 4D resampling (also backported to 24.1.4) and adds **experimental support for the X5 format** (*BIDS*).
The X5 support enables I/O for linear and nonlinear transforms and includes partial support for transformation chainsâ€”marking a first step
toward full *BIDS* interoperability.
This release also drops support for *Python* 3.9 and earlier, aligning with modern *Python* standards and paving the way for future improvements.

24.0.0 (August 18, 2024)
========================
A new series incorporating several major changes, including bugfixes and taking on several
housekeeping/maintenance actions.
One relevant change is the outsourcing of the ``apply()`` member out of
transformation data structures by @jmarabotto.
The method ``apply()`` is now a standalone method that operates on one transform
and images/surfaces/etc. provided as arguments.
A later major development is the adoption of a foundation for surface transforms by @feilong
and @Shotgunosine.
